In this directory, there are several self documented notebooks containing data and code used to produce the results/figures described in the PDF repoort titled "Quantum Advantage in Machine Learning: Investigating Entanglement and Quantum Feature Maps in Neural Networks" (arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00027 and new version to be linked soon). All code was generated using Python v3.9.0, PyTorch v2.0.0 and Qiskit v0.37.1 which can be pip installed. Below is an explanation of each folder's contents and installation.

## Installation 
This project requires Python version 3.9.0 and above, as well as Qiskit v2.0.0 and PyTorch v3.9.0. Installation of these packages and all dependencies, can be done using pip:

`$ python -m pip install qiskit==2.0.0` \
`$ python -m pip install torch==3.9.0`
